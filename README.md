# Get Started with YOLO Algorithm
YOLO is one of the most popular deep learning algorithm for object detection and classification. There are my versions of YOLO, started woth v3, v4, v5, v6 and v7. In this doc we will try on YOLOv3 first, then jump to YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 in other doc.

- Prerequisite Library
- Brief of CNN
- YOLOv3 for Images, Video and Live Cam (webcam or ipcam)
- Simple GUI
- Extract Class

In this doc, let's we assume that you are in intermediate level of Python programming.

## Prerequisite Library
YOLO algorithm required two fundamentals libraries, there are OpenCV or cv2 and numpy. It's not hard to understand how to use this library. There are thousand of tutorial and guidance to understand those libraries.
These are tutorial for them:
- [OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o)
- [OpenCV Official](https://opencv.org/)
- [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1mALgck6Lk&list=PLZS-MHyEIRo6V6C2PHEx2Lt0hWIB_cL58)

## Brief of CNN
Convolutional neural Network or CNN is a powerfull alorithm to run YOLO. We should have fundamental understanding with this algoritm.

## YOLOv3 for Images, Video and Live Cam (webcam or ipcam)
YOLOv3 is the original version of YOLO family. There are various version of YOLO, there are v4, v5, v6, and the newest is v7. We will discuss about the original one first.

YOLOv3 can used for image and video (technically video is just a multiple images), both of recorded or live camera. I've upload YOLOv3 code for image and video.
